      <h3>
        Elixirbeard's Finest Concoctions is run by Elixirbeard himself, with children from the "Her Lady of Mercy"
        orphanage attending. 50% of all proceeds go to benefit the Orphanage.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Beginning life as an orphan himself, Elixirbeard left the orphanage at an early age, seeking his fortune. After
        exploring for over 100 years, helping end the Shar'Rutagh Conflict (among other amazing feats!), Elixirbeard returned home.
        He renovated the orphanage, and became a beacon of light and solidarity in our fine city.
